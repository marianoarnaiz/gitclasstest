Machine Head is the last album recorded by what is considered the "classic" lineup of British Hard Rock outfit, Deep Purple. It was recorded in Montreux in the winter of 1971, and released to major success in 1972. Most, if not all the tracks are considered nowadays quintessential classic rock songs. Among them: Highway Star and Smoke on the Water are the best known.
Most of the songs are characterized by intricate keyboard, guitar and drums parts that take advantage of simple, in comparison, bass lines and lyrical content.
